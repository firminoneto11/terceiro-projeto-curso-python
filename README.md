<!--How do i download the repository section-->
<div align='center'><h2>ðŸ¤” How do i download the repository? ðŸ¤”</h2></div>
<br/>
<p>To download this repository on your machine, you need the following elements installed: </p>

- [x] Python 3 or superior;
- [x] A source-code editor. I prefer using the <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/'>PyCharm</a> editor, but feel free to use any other from your preference;
- [x] The <a href='https://git-scm.com/download/win'>Git</a> bash terminal;

<p>Once you got all of these installed, run the following command in the git bash terminal to download this repository: </p>

```bash
https://github.com/firminoneto11/terceiro-projeto-curso-python.git
```

<p>If you just want to run the code without any editing, download the 'pyinstaller' lib with the PIP - Python Index Package. Type the following command on your terminal: </p>

```pip
pip install pyinstaller
```

<p>After it's installation, go to the directory that you download this repository, open up a cmd window there, and type this line of code: </p>

```powershell
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon="valware.ico" BankSimulator.py
```

<p>This will create an '.exe' application, that you can run it without opening the source-code editor. Also, make sure that the anti-virus is not enabled, because sometimes it identifies as a threat.<br/>
Now that you are all set and good to go, the files that needs to be executed are:

- BankSimulator.py -> Execute this one if you didn't created the '.exe' file with the pyinstaller.
- BankSimulator.exe -> This one will be inside a directory named 'dist' if you created the '.exe' file. You also have to move it to the repository folder after the creation, because it needs access to the 'valware.ico' to show the icon.
