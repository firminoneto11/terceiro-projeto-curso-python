<div align='center'><h2>🤔 How do i download the repository? 🤔</h2></div>
<br/>
<p>To download this repository on your machine, you need the following elements installed: </p>

- [x] Python 3 or superior;
- [x] A source-code editor. I prefer using the <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/'>PyCharm</a> editor, but feel free to use any other from your preference;
- [x] The <a href='https://git-scm.com/download/win'>Git</a> bash terminal;

<p>Once you got all of these installed, run the following command in the git bash terminal to download this repository: </p>

```bash
https://github.com/firminoneto11/terceiro-projeto-curso-python.git
```

<p>If you just want to run the code without any editing, download the 'pyinstaller' lib with the PIP - Python Index Package. Type the following command on your terminal: </p>

```pip
pip install pyinstaller
```

<p>After it's installation, go to the directory that you download this repository, open up a cmd window there, and type this line of code: </p>

```powershell
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon="valware.ico" BankSimulator.py
```

<p>This will create an '.exe' application, that you can run it without opening the source-code editor. Also, make sure that the anti-virus is not enabled, because sometimes it identifies as a threat.<br/>
Now you are all set and good to go! 👍
